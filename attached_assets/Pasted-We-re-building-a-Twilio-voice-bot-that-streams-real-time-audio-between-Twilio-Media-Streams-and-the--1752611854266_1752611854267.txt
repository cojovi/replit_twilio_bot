We’re building a Twilio voice-bot that streams real-time audio between Twilio Media Streams and the OpenAI Realtime API so callers can talk to different AI “agents” on the same phone line without restarting the server.

Current codebase
Fork of Twilio’s sample repo speech-assistant-openai-realtime-api-python (MIT). 
GitHub

My fork lives at github.com/cojovi/speech-assistant-openai-realtime-api-python, folder cmac_caller/. Key files:

cmac_multi.py – FastAPI app that

/make-call/{number}?agent=alex dials out through Twilio

/inbound-call-handler & /outbound-call-handler return TwiML <Connect><Stream> that points Twilio at /media-stream

/media-stream bridges the Twilio WS to wss://api.openai.com/v1/realtime/ws, injecting the chosen agent’s system prompt and piping audio both ways 
GitHub

prompts.py – single source-of-truth dict PROMPTS (alex, jessica, stacy, etc.) so the front-end can switch personalities on the fly with ?agent=. Two placeholders (mitch, eddie) still TODO. 
GitHub

A legacy one-off cmac_jessica.py still exists but throws NameError: INBOUND_GREETING and is being retired.

Where we left off / open issues
Hot-switch personalities works conceptually via the query-string, but we need confirmation that the correct prompt is loaded into the initial messages array each time and that no state leaks between calls.

Audio bridge bugs: occasional WS errors (extra_headers w/ uvloop) and some calls hang with silence – likely buffering or base64 encoding mismatch Twilio→OpenAI→Twilio.

Front-end: bare-bones static page served, returns 304; not critical yet.

Recording callback is stubbed (/recording-status-callback) – will eventually push MP3 + transcript to our CRM.

Env vars required in .env: OPENAI_API_KEY, TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER, optional PORT.

What I need next
Audit media() handler to ensure full-duplex audio flows without race conditions (Twilio noise → OpenAI latency → Twilio playback).

Confirm personality isolation and advise on a safer pattern if multiple concurrent calls request different agents.

Replace the placeholders in prompts.py with robust prompts for “mitch” and “eddie”.

Suggest best practice for scaling: multiple worker processes vs. one process with async tasks, and any Twilio/OpenAI rate-limit considerations.

Return exact file patches or new snippets, not high-level theory. Keep answers concise and runnable.
