# Voice Bot Setup Guide

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

Your voice bot is now working with basic TwiML responses. When you make a call:

1. **Phone rings** ✅
2. **Call connects** ✅  
3. **Agent speaks** ✅ (using static messages)
4. **No application error** ✅

## Current Implementation

The system now uses **static TwiML responses** that work without external webhooks:

- **Alex**: "Hello, this is Alex from CMAC customer care. How can I help you today?"
- **Jessica**: "Hi, this is Jessica calling about our hailstorm damage services. Are you available to discuss your property?"
- **Stacy**: "Hello, this is Stacy from the dental office. I wanted to follow up about scheduling your appointment."

## Upgrade to Full AI Conversations

To enable **real-time AI conversations** with OpenAI Realtime API:

### Step 1: Install ngrok
```bash
# Download ngrok from https://ngrok.com/download
# Or install via package manager
brew install ngrok  # macOS
# or
sudo apt install ngrok  # Ubuntu
```

### Step 2: Run ngrok
```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

This creates a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

### Step 3: Set Environment Variable
```bash
export FASTAPI_URL=https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io
```

### Step 4: Update Code
The system will automatically use the ngrok URL for webhooks and enable:
- **Real-time conversations** with OpenAI
- **Natural voice interactions** 
- **Dynamic responses** based on user input
- **WebSocket streaming** for low latency
